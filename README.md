- **Output Access**: Server paths for all result files (raw, delimited, reports)
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copying of file paths for server access

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for modern, utility-first styling
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Axios** for HTTP API communication

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Access to ATH API service (see API documentation)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ath-ui
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API Endpoint**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-ath-api-server:port
   ```
   
   **Default**: `http://localhost:3000` (if no .env file is present)

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## API Requirements

This UI requires the following ATH API endpoints to be available:
